Summary: My second first blog post

### Hello, World!

Welcome to my data blog. It has forever been on my to-do list to document some of the data-y things that I've been working on that I find interesting and that I think some others also may find interesting or helpful. After 2 years of procrastination, it is time. Welcome!

To kick things off, I thought it would be fun to reflect on the first end-to-end data project I ever completed, back in February of 2015. If your first thought was "I bet you he did a project on Citibike data", go ahead and pat yourself on the back. I apologize in advance for contributing to the ad nauseam amount of Citibike of posts that exist on the internet. Hopefully you find my unique take particularly interesting!
